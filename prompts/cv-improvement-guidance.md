## CV IMPROVEMENT GUIDANCE (CRITICAL)

For "cv_improvement_suggestions", provide actionable, positive feedback:

### immediate_fixes

Identify 3-5 specific issues that hurt ATS/AI parsing. For EACH issue provide:

- "issue": What's wrong (be specific, quote from CV if possible)
- "impact": How this hurts ATS parsing or scoring (e.g., "Causes skill extraction to fail", "Reduces keyword match by 30%")
- "fix": Step-by-step instructions to fix it
- "example": Show concrete before/after transformation

Common issues to check:

- Missing or unclear job titles/dates → Add: "fix": "Add job title in format: 'Senior Developer | Company Name | Jan 2020 - Present'", "example": "Before: 'Worked at TechCorp doing development' → After: 'Senior Backend Developer | TechCorp | Jan 2020 - Dec 2023'"
- Vague descriptions → Add: "fix": "Replace vague statement with quantified achievement", "example": "Before: 'Improved system performance' → After: 'Optimized database queries reducing response time by 40% for 50K daily users'"
- Skills buried in paragraphs → Add: "fix": "Create dedicated SKILLS section with comma-separated list", "example": "Before: 'I have experience using React, Node.js and worked with AWS' → After: Add SKILLS section: 'Languages: JavaScript, TypeScript | Frameworks: React, Node.js, Express | Cloud: AWS (EC2, S3, Lambda)'"
- Generic buzzwords without proof → Add: "fix": "Replace buzzword with specific example", "example": "Before: 'Team player with great communication skills' → After: 'Led cross-functional team of 5 developers and 2 designers, conducting daily standups and sprint planning that improved delivery velocity by 25%'"

### keyword_optimization

- "missing_keywords": List 5-10 critical keywords from job description NOT found in CV (exact matches matter for ATS)
  - Include technical skills (e.g., "Kubernetes", "GraphQL", "CI/CD")
  - Include methodologies (e.g., "Agile", "Scrum", "Test-Driven Development")
  - Include tools (e.g., "Jenkins", "Docker", "PostgreSQL")
  - Include domain terms (e.g., "microservices", "API design", "cloud architecture")
- "how_to_add": Provide 2-3 specific examples showing WHERE and HOW to add keywords naturally:
  - Example: "Add 'Docker' and 'Kubernetes' to your DevOps project description: 'Containerized microservices using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes, reducing deployment time by 60%'"
  - Example: "Incorporate 'Agile' and 'Scrum' in your role description: 'Participated in Agile/Scrum ceremonies including daily standups, sprint planning, and retrospectives as part of a 7-person team'"
  - Focus on authentic integration - don't just list keywords, show them in ACTION

### formatting_tips

Provide 2-3 actionable formatting fixes with examples:

- ATS-friendly structure: "Use simple section headers: EXPERIENCE, SKILLS, EDUCATION, CERTIFICATIONS (avoid graphics, tables, columns, or text boxes that break parsing)"
- Date consistency: "Standardize all dates to same format: 'Jan 2020 - Dec 2023' or '01/2020 - 12/2023' (not mixed formats)"
- Bullet structure: "Start each bullet with action verb + quantified result: '• Developed REST API serving 100K requests/day' (not paragraphs or dense text blocks)"
- File format: "Save as .docx or .pdf with standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman) - avoid fancy fonts or embedded images"
- Contact info: "Place email, phone, LinkedIn at top in plain text (not in header/footer which ATS often skips)"

### content_enhancements

Provide 3-5 specific content improvements with examples:

- Quantify achievements: "Add metrics to your accomplishments. Example: 'Optimized database queries' → 'Optimized 50+ database queries, reducing page load time from 3.2s to 0.8s (75% improvement) for 200K daily users'"
- Add project details if experience is light: "Create a PROJECTS section highlighting relevant work: 'E-commerce Platform (Node.js, React, MongoDB) - Built RESTful API with authentication, payment integration (Stripe), and real-time inventory management. Deployed on AWS with CI/CD pipeline.'"
- Tailor professional summary: "Rewrite summary to mirror job requirements. Example: 'Software Engineer with 5 years experience' → 'Senior Backend Engineer with 5+ years building scalable Node.js microservices, RESTful APIs, and cloud infrastructure (AWS), seeking to leverage expertise in [Company's tech stack]'"
- Add relevant certifications: "Consider adding: 'AWS Certified Solutions Architect', 'MongoDB Professional', or relevant Udemy/Coursera courses that match job requirements"
- Show progression: "Highlight career growth: 'Promoted from Junior to Senior Developer in 18 months' or 'Advanced from team member to technical lead managing 3 developers'"

Be constructive, specific, and actionable. Frame as opportunities for improvement, not criticism.
